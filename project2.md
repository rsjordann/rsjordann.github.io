## Project description

The Battleship game is an implementation of a board game in which players try to sink their opponents ships, all conducted through command line input. This was a C++ project I completed for my CSCI 235 Procedural Programming course. It emulates the process in which players alternate turns in an attempt to 'sink' their opponents ships before they are sunk themselves.  

Key Features:

- Supports 2 players

- Users receive feedback for each move made alongside board representation.  

- Ships are placed on the board automatically.  


## How to compile and run the program

To compile and run the Battleship game, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```terminal
    cd ./BattleshipGame
    ```

2. Compile the C++ code:
    ```terminal
    g++ -o battleship main.cpp
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```terminal
    ./battleship
    ```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
